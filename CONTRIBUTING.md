# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing!

## Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes locally
3. Commit with meaningful messages
4. Push and open a Pull Request

## Pull Request Rules

- PRs must be reviewed
- CI checks must pass
- No direct commits to `main`

## Code Standards

- Follow repository conventions
- Keep changes small and focused
